# Voice Input Fixes Summary

**Fixes:**

3. **Updated README.md**
   - Added voice input to features list
   - Added link to troubleshooting guide
   - Updated documentation section

## Technical Details

### Permission Flow:
1. User clicks microphone button
2. Check if permissions API is available
3. Query current permission state
4. If denied, show helpful error and stop
5. If allowed or prompt, start recognition
6. Browser handles permission prompt if needed
7. Handle errors with specific guidance

### Error Types Handled:
- **NotAllowedError**: Permission denied by user
- **NotFoundError**: No microphone hardware
- **AbortedError**: Recognition was cancelled
- **no-speech**: No speech detected
- **already started**: Recognition already running

### Browser Support:
- ✅ Chrome (best)
- ✅ Edge (best)
- ✅ Safari (good)
- ⚠️ Firefox (works but limited)
- ❌ IE (not supported)

## Testing

### To Test:
1. **First Use**: Should show info banner and tooltip
2. **Permission Grant**: Click Allow when browser prompts
3. **Permission Deny**: Should show helpful error message
4. **Already Denied**: Should check and warn before starting
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Test in different browsers
6. **No Microphone**: Should detect and inform user

### Expected Behavior:
- Info banner dismisses permanently after clicking "Got it"
- Tooltip shows appropriate message based on state
- Errors are clear and actionable
- No console spam
- Graceful degradation

## User Benefits

1. **Clear Communication**: Users know what to expect
2. **Better Guidance**: Step-by-step help for issues
3. **Less Frustration**: Proactive problem prevention
4. **Accessibility**: Still works without microphone (can type)
5. **Privacy**: Explains when/why mic is used

## Code Quality
